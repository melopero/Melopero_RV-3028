## How to use

### Use of the alarm interrupt
Prior to entering any timer settings for the Alarm Interrupt, it is recommended to disable the alarm to prevent inadvertent interrupts on the INT pin:
```python 
rtc.enable_alarm(enable = False, generate_interrupt = False) 
```
*Note: Disabling the alarm will reset your alarm settings*

You can set the interrupt settings with the following functions:
```python 
rtc.set_minute_alarm(42)
rtc.set_hour_alarm(16)
rtc.set_date_alarm(24) # or rtc.set_weekday_alarm(0)
```

Any combination of alarm settings can be used. The table below describes the effect of the combined alarm settings.

|Weekday/Date Alarm   | Hour Alarm  | Minute Alarm  | Alarm Event |
| ------------------- |-------------| --------------| :------: |
| enabled             | enabled     | enabled       | When minutes, hours and weekday/date match (once per weekday/date)|
| enabled             | enabled     | disabled      | When hours and weekday/date match (once per weekday/date)          |
| enabled             | disabled    | enabled       | When minutes and weekday/date match (once per hour per weekday/date) |
| enabled             | disabled    | disabled      | When weekday/date match (once per weekday/date) 1                |
| disabled            | enabled     | enabled       | When hours and minutes match (once per day)                        |
| disabled            | enabled     | disabled      | When hours match (once per day)                                      |
| disabled            | disabled    | enabled       | When minutes match (once per hour)                               |
| disabled            | disabled    | disabled      | All disabled â€“ Default value                                       |

Finally you can activate the alarm :
```python 
rtc.enable_alarm(enable = True, generate_interrupt = True) 
```

### Use of the countdown timer
### Use of the user RAM registers
There are two free RAM bytes, which can be used for any purpose. These registers can be accessed with the following functions:
```python 
rtc.read_register(RV_3028.USER_RAM1_ADDRESS) # returns the value stored in the register at address USER_RAM1_ADDRESS (0x1F)
rtc.write_register(RV_3028.USER_RAM2_ADDRESS, 0x42) # writes 0x42 to the register at address USER_RAM2_ADDRESS (0x20)
```
*Note: these functions can be used to read and write to any register of the RAM*
### Use of the EEPROM as user memory
